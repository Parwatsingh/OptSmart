# 5) Content
	1. < inp-params.txt >   ::::  Make sure that this file is in the <inp-output> directory.
	2. < main.cpp >         ::::  Source file for <Serial> Miner and Validator Algorithm.
	3. < Util/FILEOPR.h >   ::::  Header file defines File related input/output function.
	4. < Util/Timer.h >     ::::  Header file defines time related functions.
	5. < Contract/Coin.h >  ::::  Header file defines <Smart Contract> functions.
	6. < README.md >        ::::  This File.
	7. < Makefile >         ::::  Used to compile the src.
	8. < run.py   >         ::::  Python script used to run the program.

# 6) Compile on Linux(X86_64)
	$ g++ main.cpp -std=c++17 -o main

# 7) Execute
	$./main <num of block> <num of validators> <num of Iterations>
	E.g.: ./main 10 50 20

# 8) Input
	1. <inp-output/inp-params.txt>
		Note: inp-params.txt, content should be a single line with space separated 4 values as follows:
		5 10 1000 .5
		Where:
		1. m: # of SObj; 
		2. n: # of threads; 
		3. K: # of Total AUs or Transactions; 
		4. Î»: Random delay seed
	2. <inp-output/listAUs.txt> :::: listAUs consist of Atomic Units generated by <GenAUs> executable in root directory for the benchmark contract, AUs are executed on smart contract by miner and validator.

# 9) Output
	The terminal outputs time taken by the concurrent miner and concurrent validators along with other useful information such as: the average number of validators accepted/rejected a block, max number of validators accepted/rejected a block, the average number of dependencies in block graph, the average number of AUs with non-zero in-degree, etc.

## 9.1) Log file
	1. <inp-output/Time.csv> :::: Time is avg time taken by miner and validator threads in microseconds.
