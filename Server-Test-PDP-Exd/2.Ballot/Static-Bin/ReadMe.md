# 1. Problem
	"Implementation of Concurrent Miner and Concurrent Validator Algorithm using Static Analysis based technique which group the AUs in the concurrent and sequential bins. Later, a decentralized validator deterministically executes the concurrent and sequential bin AUs and validate the final state."

# 6. Compile on Linux(X86_64)
	$ make

# 7. Input
	<inp-output/inp-params.txt>
	<content should be a single line with space separated 4 values as follows:>
	40 400 4 400 .2	
		Where:
		1. l: #of Proposals (SObj)
		2. m: #of Voters (SObj) 
		3. n: #of threads
		4. K: #of Total AUs/Transactions
		5. Î»: Random delay seed

# 8. Output
	The terminal output gives time taken by the concurrent miner and validator algorithm.
	
	NOTE:: Output will be from the last algorithm executed.
	1.<inp-output/AtomicUnits.txt> :::: AtomicUnits consists of Atomic Units generated by Algorithm, AUs are executed on smart contract by miner and validator.
	2.<inp-output/Output_Time.txt> :::: Output_Time is avg time taken by an AU, the miner, and the validator algorithm in microseconds.
